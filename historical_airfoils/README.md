Historical Airfoils
-------------------

This folder contains the coordinate files (and eventually data) of previously published airfoils.  These airfoils are taken from a variety of sources in the literature, which are provided in each of the sub directories.

In some instances, airfoil coordinate files are unavailable.  However, published literature does show images of these airfoils, either independently or as a stacked family.  In these instances, airfoils have been fit to the image files of these airfoils, to get a best possible representation distributable in an open-source format.  The fitting routine and PNG images used to fit have been provided in the `image_processing` folder.
