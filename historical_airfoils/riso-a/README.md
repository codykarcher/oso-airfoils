These airfoils are fitted to images of the airfoils from the following reference:

1. Dahl, K. S., and Fuglsang, P., “Design of the Wind Turbine Airfoil Family RISØ-A-XX,” Technical Report, Riso National Laboratory, Roskilde, Denmark, December 1998. URL: https://backend.orbit.dtu.dk/ws/files/7731729/ris_r_1024.pdf

Due to fitting uncertainty, these coordinate file will **not** match the exact coordinate files of the actual RISO-A airfoils.
