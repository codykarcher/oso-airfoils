These airfoils are fitted to images of the airfoils from the following reference:

1. Fuglsang, P., Bak, C., Gaunaa, M., and Antoniou, I., “Design and Verification of the Risø-B1 Airfoil Family for Wind Turbines,”Journal of Solar Energy Engineering, Vol. 126, No. 4,2004, p. 1002. URL: https://doi.org/10.1115/1.1766024

Due to fitting uncertainty, these coordinate file will **not** match the exact coordinate files of the actual RISO-B airfoils.
